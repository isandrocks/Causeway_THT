 My first keyboard DIY kit! 
 
This board is useing the ATmega32A MCU and running QMK Custom firmware. 

The basic layout of the board is a copy of the Boardwalk Ortho 5x14 with some extra configurations that can be swapped out.

This board was heavly inspaird by the Discipline 65% by ![coseyfannitutti](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/discipline) and the ![Boardwalk](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/boardwalk/readme.md) for the layout.

Everything for this project was done in the free viersons of KiCad 7 and Fusion 360.
