This board is useing the ATmega32A MCU and running QMK Custom firmware.

This board was heavly inspaird by the Discipline 65% by ![coseyfannitutti](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/discipline) and the ![Boardwalk](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/boardwalk/readme.md) for the layout.
